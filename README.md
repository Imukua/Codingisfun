### a. [Lina's Instructions Website](./Lina's_site/)

I decided to embark on a creative endeavor â€“ crafting unique projects just for the fun of it. One such project was creating a website of instructions. Lina, a close friend, approached me with a query on how to install Microsoft Office. Instead of merely sharing the steps, I went the extra mile. I built a captivating static website for her, complete with clear instructions and engaging visuals.
